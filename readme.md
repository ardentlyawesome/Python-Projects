# Basic Python Projects

This is a repository of very basic python projects I made while learning python. 

They include:
1. Binary Search: basically, implementation of Binary Search algorithm in Python.

2. Guess the Number: implementing the use of Random in Python. You guess your number and make the computer guess random number tills it finds the right one.

3. Hangman: Playing Hangman in Python!

4. Calculator: A calculator using TKinter in Python

5. Minesweeper: A python implementation of Minesweeper! The game is Terminal Based for now, but a boring weekend might change that someday!

6. Rock Paper Scissors: rock paper scissors (practice with functions and if statements)

7. Sudoku Solver: Sudoku Solver using Backtracking!

8. TicTacToe: An intelligent TicTacToe, in which by editing the player.py document you can play with Computer or Smart Computer which is using Min Max Algorithm to make an unwinnable TicTacToe.

These projects were made as a means of implementing the knowledge I learn in college as well as strengthening Python Concepts etc.
